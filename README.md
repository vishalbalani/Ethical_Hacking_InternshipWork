I have conducted a vulnerability scan on the website as part of an educational project. Please note that this scan was carried out with full authorization and permission from the website owner.

The scan took place on 15-06-2023, and I have prepared a comprehensive report detailing the findings. This report aims to highlight potential vulnerabilities present within the website and does not intend to exploit or misuse any identified weaknesses.
